    "Regarded as a cultural phenomenon, the adidas Yeezy Boost 350 silhouette generated a cult following when it was initially released in 2015. This ‘Glow’ makeover—released in May 2019—equips the Primeknit upper with a high-visibility treatment and a translucent stripe to the lateral profile. Integrated lacing and a coordinating heel pull provide easy on/off. Underfoot, the signature full-length Boost midsole looks to the future with a bright glow in the dark finish.",

    "Inspired by Michael Jordan’s alma mater, the Off-White x Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG ‘UNC’ carries a classic two-tone composition, filtered through Virgil Abloh’s unique design prism. The process involves taking a white leather base with dark powder blue overlays and adding embellishments that convey an expressive, handmade quality. They include detached Wings, a floating Swoosh, and lines of text on the medial-side quarter panel delineating the taxonomy of the shoe.",
